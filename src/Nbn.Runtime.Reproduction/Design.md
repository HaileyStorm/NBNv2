# Nbn.Runtime.Reproduction

Owns compatibility gates, child synthesis, mutation summaries, and spawn policy behavior.

## Stable responsibilities

- Function mutation keeps full ID-space compatibility (no hard bans), while biasing activation/reset/accumulation mutation targets toward lower-volatility families so child brains trend toward stable buffer ranges over generations.

## Maintenance guidance

Keep this file concise and decision-focused. Update when stable behavior, ownership boundaries, or invariants change. Prefer editing/replacing stale text over appending long history; avoid transient run logs or speculative notes.
