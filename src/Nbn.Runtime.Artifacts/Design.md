# Nbn.Runtime.Artifacts

Owns artifact fetch/store contracts, dedup manifests, and artifact reference semantics.

## Maintenance guidance

Keep this file concise and decision-focused. Update when stable behavior, ownership boundaries, or invariants change. Prefer editing/replacing stale text over appending long history; avoid transient run logs or speculative notes.
